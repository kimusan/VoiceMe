# VoiceMe Permissions

This document tracks every Android permission VoiceMe requests and why. Keep it current with each release.

## Implemented capabilities

| Permission / capability | Required for | Current status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RECORD_AUDIO` | Capturing speech while the user explicitly starts dictation | Runtime permission requested from the Status screen. The current foreground shell opens local `AudioRecord`; no ASR model is connected and raw audio is not persisted. |
| `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` | Running a visible service while microphone capture is active | Declared for the recording shell. The service shows a persistent low-importance notification while active. |
| `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MICROPHONE` | Android foreground-service type for microphone capture | Declared for `VoiceMeRecordingService` so microphone capture happens under the explicit microphone foreground-service type. |
| `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` | Showing foreground-service status on Android versions that gate notifications | Declared so the app can present the microphone foreground-service notification. Runtime notification prompting still needs a polished production flow. |
| Accessibility service binding (`android.permission.BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE`) | User-enabled service that detects focused editable fields and hosts the keyboard-adjacent mic preview control | Registered in the app manifest. The service requests window-content capability so Android can identify focused editable fields. The service checks editable/focused/password metadata, hides for password fields by default, and shows a draggable accessibility overlay preview. On explicit overlay tap, it reads the focused field text to append the fixed ASR-stub phrase and calls `ACTION_SET_TEXT`. |

## Planned permissions

| Permission / capability | Required for | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Internet/network | Real model downloads or optional update metadata | Not declared yet. Add only when real download/checksum flows are implemented; avoid in offline/F-Droid flavor if practical and never use for cloud transcription by default. |
| Input method service | Optional VoiceMe keyboard fallback | More reliable text insertion, but user must switch keyboards. |

## Permissions intentionally avoided

- Contacts, calendar, location, SMS, call log, camera, and account permissions are not part of the product scope.
- Overlay permission (`SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW`) should not be needed for the MVP if the accessibility overlay is sufficient.
- Network permission is intentionally still absent until real, user-initiated model download code exists.

## Sensitive-field policy

VoiceMe should not dictate into password fields or other fields Android marks as sensitive. The app hides or disables the dictation button when such a field is detected by default.
